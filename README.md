# Australia-Rains-Prediction-Project-by-IBM
Classification algorithms applied to predict rain fall in Australia


In this final project, I will incorporate the classification algorithms that are laid down below.

I will apply classification algorithms to build a model using our training data, and assess the performance of this model on our testing data using the evaluation metrics also given below.

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, I will use the models to generate the report at the end.


Please download the notebook and run the codes. Different environments may require different packages and libraries. Please consider them. I have used Skills Network and Jupyter to run the codes. The accuracies of each model are given and you can implement the model on different data sets as well.
